## How to Run This Project

To run this application on your local machine, you'll need Python 3 installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dcs325/pokemon_advisor.git
cd pokemon_advisor
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Due to system package management restrictions, it's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

This project uses `pygame` for battle sound effects. Install it using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** The application also requires `tkinter`, which is included in most standard Python installations. If you get an error about `tkinter` not being found, you may need to install it separately (e.g., `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` on Debian/Ubuntu).

### 4. Add the Music File (Optional)

For the battle sound effects to work, you need to add a music file named `pokemon_battle_theme.mp3` to the main project folder.

**If you don't have the music file:**
- The application will still work perfectly without it
- You'll just miss the battle sound effects during analysis

### 5. Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the app with the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Now you can select your Pok√©mon and an opponent to get an instant matchup analysis with battle sounds! üéµ

## Battle Sound Features

- **Automatic Playback:** Battle music starts automatically when you click "Analyze Matchup"
- **5-Second Duration:** Music plays for exactly 5 seconds then stops automatically
- **No Manual Controls:** Seamless integration with the analysis workflow
- **Graceful Fallback:** App works perfectly even without the music file

## Development

### Running the Legacy Version

If you want to run the original monolithic version, use:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

### Code Organization

The application has been refactored into a modular structure:

- **`src/data/`**: Contains all Pok√©mon and type effectiveness data
- **`src/utils/`**: Contains utility functions for calculations and music management
- **`src/gui/`**: Contains the Tkinter GUI implementation
- **`main.py`**: The new entry point that orchestrates all components

This modular structure makes the code:
- **Maintainable**: Each module has a single responsibility
- **Testable**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
- **Extensible**: New features can be added without modifying existing code
- **Readable**: Clear separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand

### Troubleshooting

**No Battle Sounds:**
- Make sure `pokemon_battle_theme.mp3` is in the project root folder
- Ensure pygame is installed: `pip install pygame`
- Check that your system volume is not muted

**Pygame Installation Issues:**
- Use a virtual environment to avoid system package conflicts
- On macOS, you might need to use `brew install pygame` as an alternative
